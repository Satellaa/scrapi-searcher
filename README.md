  <strong>Utility bot for EDOPro scripting and development</strong>
</p>

Displays scrapiyard documentation and BabelCDB card information on [Discord](https://discord.com/),
and provides other useful commands for EDOPro-related development.

---

Searcher primarily aims to be a Project Ignis devtool to be used by scripters and developers.
It is not meant to be a general-use _Yu-Gi-Oh!_ card information bot.
Auxiliary card data that are not relevant to the simulator
such as card prices and pack release dates are considered non-goals.

## Usage

The bot is available in the [Project Ignis Discord server](https://discord.gg/ygopro-percy)
and in private messages. A full list of commands can be accessed using `,command`.
Cards can be searched from within messages using curly braces, e.g. `{Silhouhatte Rabbit}`.

The bot is set to private and cannot be added to other servers
to minimize server load and avoid mandatory Discord bot verification.
If you would like to self-host or have general questions about the bot,
you can reach out to @that-hatter (or `@that.hatter` on Discord).
